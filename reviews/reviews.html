            <p>"Very well put together game. Makes it easy for a causal player to just pick this up and play. New movement certainly caters for the casual gamers as well. Campaign has to be one of the best they have made and definitely recommend playing it (also get rewards for completing it). 
                Some glitches here and there on release, but its not something that can't be fixed with an update or so. Graphics is spectacular but some bugs time to time makes it feel not as polished as it should be. The UI is new so don't expect to know how to navigate around the menu straight away but 
                its something that is easy to get used to. Overall, this game has been one of the best Activision has put out for a very long time. Expect nothing less from IW devs."

        <p>"Multiplayer is great. New maps are awesome...meat, Vista, etc... MW Zombies super fun plenty of hours of gamepley there. Campaign is terrible, but most don't play it anyways. Movement is faster than mw2 but not too fast. Lots of guns are balanced. Warzone is free but uses same mechanics. Plays very well. I got the game in sale 50$ perfect price for remastered skins plus all the new maps.."</p>

    <p>"I loved this campaign!!! Definitely a 9 out of 10. Story was great, mechanics (PS5) were on point with no issues, and I fell in love with the characters all over again, including the newbies. The only issue I had was the checkpoints; played on Veteran first playthrough. There were times were I got stuck dying immediately after respawning but eventually, with some light raging, I got through it. Definitely recommend getting this game if you haven't already. *P.S. Don't listen to IGN; they don't know what they are talking about lol

    <p>"This is a great game, as long as you want to commit to it, think of it as a full time job the only problems are the sweaty lobbies and the camo grind. The camo grind is a pain but you can deal with it. The game keeps pumping out updates almost every Thursday so they’ll have you doing something. If you don’t like the game you’re just bad. So if you want to get this game just remember it’s not for everyone and you might not like it but it still can be fun sometimes. Also DMZ is fun.
